Electricity Cost Calculator

📌 Project Description

The Electricity Cost Calculator** is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to calculate the **daily, monthly, and yearly electricity cost** of household appliances.

Users input the appliance name, wattage, number of hours used per day, and the electricity rate (PHP per kWh). The program then automatically computes energy consumption and corresponding costs.

This project demonstrates the application of **Java Swing GUI**, basic **mathematical formulas**, and **real-life problem solving** related to electricity consumption.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To apply Java programming concepts in a real-world scenario
* To practice creating a graphical user interface using Java Swing
* To understand how electricity consumption and cost are calculated
* To develop logical and mathematical problem-solving skills

---

## 🧮 Formulas Used

### Energy Consumption

```
kWh/day = (Wattage × Hours Used per Day) ÷ 1000
```

### Cost Computation

```
Daily Cost   = kWh/day × Rate per kWh
Monthly Cost = Daily Cost × 30
Yearly Cost  = Daily Cost × 365
```
